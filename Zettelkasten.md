[20220106953](202201060953) Zettelkesten knowledge organization system

The zettelkesten system is used to organize thoughts about information into a web of knowledge. Each zettel should have a unique identifier. I'll be using a time based id, yyyymmddhhmm. The principle of atomicity should be applied to each zettel as well. Meaning each zettel should cover one kand only one thought or idea.

Tags can be used to identify related zettels. These tags shouldn't be used as categories, but rather as keys to find related thoughts.
